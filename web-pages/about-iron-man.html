        <h3>Iron Man's Origin</h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark, was a very rich, and intelligent inventer, 
            even designed weapons for the U.S. military. When a group of terrorists from the middle east discovered how powerful the weapons 
            he designed realy were, they kidnapped him, held him as a prisoner, and forced him to develope the weapons for them. While trapped 
            in the cave, instead of developing a weapon for the terrorists, he developed his first suit of armor, named Mark 1. Using Mark 1, 
            he managed to escape captivity, and return home, where he began developement of a new suit of armor since Mark 1 wasn't able to survive 
            the trip home. Iron Man has been consistently making new suits, and they are constantly improving. He has made a total of 85 suits as of 
            now. With every suit he makes, they beccome more advanced, and more powerful. His most recent suits are made using nano-technology, 
            allowing him to have his suit with him at all times, while anywhere.
