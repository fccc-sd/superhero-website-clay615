        <p id = "reasons-why">
            There are a few reasons I chose Iron Man as my favorite super hero. First of 
            all, despite being a normal human, he still fights things far more powerful 
            then him and can win. He made his first suit or armor in a cave while being 
            held prisoner. Although he has done some impressive stuff, what makes Iron 
            Man a good super hero isnt his strength or any super powers, but intelligence, 
            and a willingness to risk his life to better the world. Iron Man isn't a 
            superhero bc he has to be, he is a super hero because he wants to better the 
            world, and use his skills to help others. On top of being a good person, he is 
            extremely intelligent, able to make his suits form scratch, and making new and 
            advanced technology all the time.
